# Houston, We Have A Logic Problem

In this lesson, I looked at Python logical operators. The most popular ones: `and`, `or` , `not`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, and `<`. I'll also learn how to determine if a value is either True or False.

## Logic Operators 

The most popular truth terms in Python are: `and`, `or` , `not`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, and `<`.

There's also `in`, which is a way of putting strings or variables together. As `in`: 

```
$ python
>>> people = ["Emanoel", "Ana", "Lucas", David]
>>> "Emanoel" in people
True
```
