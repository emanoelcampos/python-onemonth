# The Famous Fizzbuzz Challenge

Challenge time! I will use my knowledge to solve the FizzBuzz Coding Challenge, one of the most common coding interview questions.

Here's the FizzBuzz challenge.

```
# Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
# But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
# and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
# For numbers that are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

# Tip: % (modulo) tells you what's left over when you divide one number by another
# ex. number % 3 == 0
```
