# Learned the Command Line Basics

In this lesson I have been reviewing the command line, also known as the terminal. The command line is used to manage Python projects and execute Python code. Commands will be used throughout the course.

## Command line basic

```
$ pwd # print working directory, ie. the folder that you are currently in.
$ open . # Use "start ." on Windows instead of open
$ ls # Use "dir" on Windows — This command will show you what's in you're current folder. 
$ cd Desktop # change you're location to 'Desktop.' 
$ cd .. # Go back to the folder behind the current folder.
$ cd ~ # Go back to main directory.
$ clear # clears everything above.
$ mkdir python #Windows: use "echo.> python.py" —  Creates a folder called Python.
```
