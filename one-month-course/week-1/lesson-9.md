# Running Python Scripts

There are two ways to run Python code - by running a script file with the python command, or by running commands in the Interactive Shell. In this lesson, I was introduced to the Interactive Shell. I learned how to set it up and use it to run Python code.

*There are two different ways to run Python code:*

## 1. Running the `.py` file

There are two different ways to execute Python code. The first is to go directly into the Terminal application and move to the location with a Python script (I already did this). Go to the Python folder, and then type

```
$ python happy_hour.py
```

## 2. Using the interactive shell

Type `python` at the command prompt, and it will take you to something called the interactive shell.

Here you can type Python code directly - basic arithmetic works, as well as printing specific strings of text. The interactive shell is a great place to test certain bits of code before adding it to your script in the IDE. To get out of the interactive shell, you can use a function called `exit()`, or just press `Ctrl+D`.
