# I took a quick break to ensure I was on the right track

In this lecture, I have verified that I have set up my development environment correctly. I tested my Python installation and made sure I had the right version of Python installed - version 3.0 or higher (I'm using 3.12).

## Checked if I have Python installed:

1. Opened a new command line window
2. Typed `python --version` and hit enter
3. My terminal showed the words `Python 3.12.2`, I'm all set!
