# Printing Function

In this lesson, I learned how to write code that prints data to the screen. Printing information shows the output of the code, and it is also useful for debugging code. I followed some Python printing examples and then created print functions and arguments from scratch.

In `lesson-10.py` I typed:

```
print("I'm learning Python!")

print("Still learning Python", "Emanoel")
```

I go back onto the command line and ran the command `python lesson-10.py`, and I'm able o print:

```
emanoel@ntbk-emanoel MINGW64 /d/python-one-month/one-month-course/week-1 (master)
$ python lesson-10.py
I'm learning Python!

emanoel@ntbk-emanoel MINGW64 /d/python-one-month/one-month-course/week-1 (master)
$ python lesson-10.py
I'm learning Python!
You are still learning Python Emanoel
```
