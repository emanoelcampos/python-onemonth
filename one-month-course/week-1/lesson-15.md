# Numbers: Float vs. Integers

In Python, integers refer to whole numbers, while floats refer to numbers with decimals. Learning to use numbers in Python is beneficial as the basic programming concepts are similar in other programming languages such as JavaScript, Java, PHP, and Ruby.

## Integers vs. floats
In Python, whole numbers are called integers and numbers with decimals are called floats.

- 3 is an integer
- 3.0 is a float
- 
You can convert between integers and floats in Python. You can also specify whether you want a float or an integer by wrapping it. 

### This code is for lesson-14.py, which has been converted to an integer to make it a whole number.
```
print("What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything", int(((40 + 30 - 7) * 2 / 3)))
```
